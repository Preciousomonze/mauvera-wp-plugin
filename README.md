MVP Mauvera plugin for Wordpress


## How to Use

#### 1 - Upload & Activate Plugin


Download the zip file "mauvera.zip" and upload either through 
- ftp/cpanel to "wp-content/plugins/".
- the WordPress dashboard in "plugin > add new" page. 


#### 2 - Use Shortcode

You can now use the shortcode anywhere on your wordpress site. Where ticket_id value is the ticket id or event id

- for ordinary link to buy ticket

```
[mauvera_ticket_link ticket_id= "5"]Click here to buy ticket[/mauvera_ticket_link]
```

```



#### 3 - Shortcode button on Visual editor and text editor


You can generate the shortcodes(since you're too tired to copy it) when using the visual or text editor. No need for screenshots, you'll notice the buttons when using the editor(s) :) .
